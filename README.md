# work2mirror

Create repository mirror from a android repo workspace. My work is base on [this](http://www.worldhello.net/2010/10/15/1992.html).
I do improvement to clean up the old workspace directory tree.

## Usage

1. Copy work2mirror.py to the Android workspace root directory.
2. Run command

   ```
   $ python work2mirror.py
   ```
